# Under-Ground-Cable-Fault-Detector-Using-IoT
A smart underground cable fault detector uses sensors to monitor current, voltage, and temperature. It employs IoT (GSM, LoRaWAN, Wi-Fi) to send data to a server, where real-time analytics detect faults. Alerts notify maintenance teams via mobile/web apps, ensuring timely detection, reduced downtime, and efficient maintenance.
